## Project structure
application - flask app (main application)

extensions - chrome extension

scripts - script that creates similarity search index and store for other libraries 

## QuickStart
Please note: current vector database uses pandas Python documentation, thus responses will be related to it, if you want to use other docs please follow a guide below

1. Navigate to `/application` folder
2. Install dependencies
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Prepare .env file
Copy .env_sample and create .env with your openai api token
4. Run the app
`python app.py`

## [How to use any other documentation]
How to train on other documentation
This AI can use any documentation, but first it needs to be prepared for similarity search.

Start by going to /scripts/ folder

If you open this file you will see that it uses RST files from the folder to create a docs.index and faiss_store.pkl.

It currently uses OPEN_AI to create vector store, so make sure your documentation is not too big. Pandas cost me around 3-4$

You can usually find documentation on github in docs/ folder for most open-source projects.

1. Find documentation in .rst and create a folder with it in your scripts directory
Name it inputs/ Put all your .rst files in there

If there are no .rst files just convert whatever you find to txt and feed it. (dont forget to change the extension in script)

2. Create .env file in scripts/ folder
And write your OpenAI API key inside OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>

3. Run scripts/ingest.py
python ingest.py

It will tell you how much it will cost

4. Move docs.index and faiss_store.pkl generated in scripts/ to application/ folder.
5. Run web app
Once you run it will use new context that is relevant to your documentation Make sure you select default in the dropdown in the UI
